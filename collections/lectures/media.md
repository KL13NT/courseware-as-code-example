You can embed YouTube videos and other media in CaC, here is some examples of
how it works and how is can be used in CaC.

## General Guidelines

Images, videos, and gifs shouldn't be added to the Git repo of your course.
Adding media files to the repo will result in its size getting exponentially
large with every added file and will make contributing difficult.

For now make sure to upload your videos to your favourite hosting service.
YouTube is a great platform for videos, and Imgur is great for images. Both
support private (unlisted) media where you can only find said media through a
provided link.

## Embedding Images

### Inline style

`![alt text](image path or link)`

## Clickable Images

while you can't embed YouTube videos (except using an iframe )directly, you can embed a clickable image that will open the video in a new tab:

`[![alt text](image path or link)](video link)`
